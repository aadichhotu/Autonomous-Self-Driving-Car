Firstly, generate a custom controller in the SunFounder App employing widgets A, C, P, and K. Ensure that both "picarx_control_3_data_rec.py" and "vilib_1.py" reside in the same folder.
Modify the folder path (/home/pi/Data_Recording/Data) in line 164 of "picarx_control_3_data_rec.py" to your preferred location for data storage.
Subsequently, execute the "picarx_control_3_data_rec.py" script on your car. Establish a connection with your app controller and commence data recording.
